DESCRIPTION

libgpuvm simplifies data transfer between host and a GPU using userspace
pagefault handling (or simply, SIGSEGV catching). It is primarily intended for
integrating GPU support into languages, although it may also be used as a
standalone library. It is based on OpenCL and UNIX syscalls, and currently
supports OpenCL-capable devices.
